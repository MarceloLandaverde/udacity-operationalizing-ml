# Operationalizing Machine Learning

*TODO:* Write an overview to your project.
In this project we will use Azure to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it. At the same time we will also create, publish, and consume a pipeline.

The main steps of the project will be the following:

- Authentication
- Automated ML Experiment
- Deploy the best model
- Enable logging
- Swagger Documentation
- Consume model endpoints
- Create and publish a pipeline
- Documentation

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

The following diagram should help us to visualize the flow of operations from start to finish.
You can map this diagram with the information and code of the Jupyter notebook.

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

***Model Deployment:*** \
To be able to deploy a model the following “Key” steps should occur:

*Enable Security and Authentication* \
This is the first step needed, then authentication is crucial for the continuous flow of operations. In this project the security and authentication steps will be generated by creating a “Service Principal”.

A “Service Principal” is a user role with controlled permissions to access specific resources. Using a service principal is a great way to allow authentication while reducing the scope of permissions, which enhances security.

In the current project the udacity lab was used, thus there was no need for creating the above mentioned steps. Nevertheless below you will find the generic steps of how this could get done:

- Using the terminal ensure the az command-line tool is installed along with the ml extension
- Authenticate
- Create the “Service Principal”

Afterwards:
- Capture the "objectId" using the clientID
- Assign the role to the new Service Principal for the given Workspace, Resource Group and User objectId

***Create and run AutoML Experiment:*** \
At this point, security is enabled and authentication is completed. In this step an experiment using Automated ML will be created. This includes to configure a compute cluster and use that cluster to run the experiment.

For the experiment, the “Bankmarketing dataset” will be used as input:

##### Registered Datasets:

Once the experiment is completed the best model will be selected as you can see in the pictures below:

##### Experiment Run completed:

##### Best Model:

***Deploy the Best Model:***\
After the experiment run completes, a summary of all the models and their metrics are shown, including explanations. In this case the best model will be selected to be deployed.

##### Best Model:

***Enable Application Insights:***\
The next will be to activate “Application Insights” which is a particularly useful tool to detect anomalies and visualize performance.

##### Application Insights Enable:
![alt text](https://github.com/MarceloLandaverde/udacity-operationalizing-ml/blob/master/4-Application_Insights.PNG)

Enabling Application Insights will be done in this case using the following python script:
##### logs.py file:
![alt text](https://github.com/MarceloLandaverde/udacity-operationalizing-ml/blob/master/4.1-LogsPY.PNG)

This python scripts basically contains the commands needed which will be run using the CLI. (See picture below)

##### Running logs.py file:
![alt text](https://github.com/MarceloLandaverde/udacity-operationalizing-ml/blob/master/4.2-LogsPYCommandLine.PNG)

***Consume Endpoints:***\
Now it is time to consume the deployed model using Swagger. Swagger is a tool that helps build, document, and consume RESTful web services like the one deployed in Azure ML Studio.

##### Interacting with Swagger:
![alt text](https://github.com/MarceloLandaverde/udacity-operationalizing-ml/blob/master/localhost9000.PNG)

##### Interacting with Swagger Deployed Model:

##### Consuming Endpoint:

***Publish and Consume a Pipeline***\
Here you can see the already created pipeline which is active:

##### Bankmarketing Train Pipeline:

##### AutoML Module:

##### Use RunDetails Widget:

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
Here you can see a short Video (14 Min) explaining the above listed steps

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
