# Operationalizing Machine Learning

*TODO:* Write an overview to your project.

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

**Model Deployment:** \
To be able to deploy a model the following “Key” steps should occur:

*Enable Security and Authentication* \
This is the first step needed, then authentication is crucial for the continuous flow of operations. In this project the security and authentication steps will be generated by creating a “Service Principal”.

A “Service Principal” is a user role with controlled permissions to access specific resources. Using a service principal is a great way to allow authentication while reducing the scope of permissions, which enhances security.

In the current project the udacity lab was used, thus there was no need for creating the above mentioned steps. Nevertheless below you will find the generic steps of how this could get done:

- Using the terminal ensure the az command-line tool is installed along with the ml extension
- Authenticate
- Create the “Service Principal”

Afterwards:
- Capture the "objectId" using the clientID
- Assign the role to the new Service Principal for the given Workspace, Resource Group and User objectId

***Create and run AutoML Experiment:*** \
At this point, security is enabled and authentication is completed. In this step an experiment using Automated ML will be created. This includes to configure a compute cluster and use that cluster to run the experiment.

For the experiment, the “Bankmarketing dataset” will be used as input:

Once the experiment is completed the best model will be selected as you can see in the pictures below:

***Deploy the Best Model:***\
After the experiment run completes, a summary of all the models and their metrics are shown, including explanations. In this case the best model will be selected to be deployed.

***Enable Application Insights:***

***Consume Endpoints:***

***Publish and Consume a Pipeline***



## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
